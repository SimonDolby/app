```

#### callback
Function executed when the player instance object is ready. JWPlayer instance object is passed as an argument.

### Example
Example usage in index.html

### Logging
By default we log all jwplayer errors through our service `event-logger`
You can browse logs in Kibana in `logstash-event-logger-*`

### Custom tracking pixel
When there is `pixel` property set in the first element of (videoDetails) playlist array, an `img`
element with this pixel will be created. The pixel property can be set in JWPlayer Dashboard as 
custom parameter. And it will be returned in `https://cdn.jwplayer.com/v2/media/{mediaId}` 
response in playlist item object.
 
For all next (related) videos played tracking pixel will be sent automatically if an url was set
in video custom parameter in jwplayer dashboard.
